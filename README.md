# SchedulerProject

This repository contains code for Shortest Remaining Time First and Multi Level Feedback Queue Scheduling using C#. 
This is created from the scratch without the usage of the provided code. The main features of the algorithm are:

1) Calculate AVergae Waiting Time
2) Claculate Average TurnAround Time
3) Calculate Throughput
4) Calculate CPU utilization

The performance metrics are compared using 10 batches of processes for each algorithm. It was found that SRTF performs better compared to the MLFQ, in terms of average waiting time, whereas MLFQ was able to provide better CPU utilization.

How to compile and run the code?
--------------------------------

1) Create a new C# console project in Visual studio
2) Copy and paste the MLFQ.cs and SRTF.cs into the project directory
3) RUn both the codes separately in order to vide the output.
